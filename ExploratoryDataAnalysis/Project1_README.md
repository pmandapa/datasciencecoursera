This assignment uses data from the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available on the course web site:

Dataset: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]

The overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. The task is to reconstruct the following plots below, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.

This folder contains four R scripts and four plots as part of the Project 1
